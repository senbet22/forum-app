## Why Designsystemet?

We're using Designsystemet to challenge ourselves with a professional design system used by Norwegian governmental websites and public services. Designsystemet is a suite of tools designed to create consistent and user-friendly digital experiences, making them more efficient and reliable. By implementing this system, we're learning how real-world design systems work while building our forum app.
