# Forum App

A modern forum application where users can create spaces, interact, and discuss different topics.

## About

This is a community forum platform that allows users to:

- Authenticate and manage their profiles
- Create and join discussion spaces
- Engage in conversations around different topics
- Connect with other users

## Why Designsystemet?

We're using Designsystemet to challenge ourselves with a professional design system used by Norwegian governmental websites and public services. Designsystemet is a suite of tools designed to create consistent and user-friendly digital experiences, making them more efficient and reliable. By implementing this system, we're learning how real-world design systems work while building our forum app.

For some tasks, you need to set up your environment variables.

### Setup

2. Add the following variables:

```env

```
